Code to implement the eight burst detection methods in the paper are located in [Burst_detection_methods](Burst_detection_methods).

Data for mouse RGC analysis from Demas et al., 2003 are available from http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/3/1/3

MEA recordings from hiPSC-derived neuronal networks are located in [hiPSC_recordings](hiPSC_recordings)
