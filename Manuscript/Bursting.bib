abstract = {The mammalian retina deconstructs the visual world using parallel neural channels, embodied in the morphological and physiological types of ganglion cells. We sought distinguishing features of each cell type in the temporal pattern of their spikes. As a first step, conventional physiological properties were used to cluster cells in eight types by a statistical analysis. We then adapted a method of P. Reinagel et al. (1999: J. Neurophysiol., 81, 2558-2569) to define epochs within the spike train of each cell. The spike trains of many cells were found to contain robust patterns that are defined by the (averaged) timing of successive interspike intervals in brief activity epochs. The patterns were robust across four different types of visual stimulus. Although the patterns are conserved in different visual environments, they do not prevent the cell from signaling the strength of its response to a particular stimulus, which is expressed in the number of spikes contained in each coding epoch. Clustering based on the spike train patterns alone showed that the spike train patterns correspond, in most but not all cases, to cell types pre-defined by traditional criteria. That the congruence is less than perfect suggests that the typing of rabbit ganglion cells may need further refinement. Analysis of the spike train patterns may be useful in this regard and for distinguishing the many unidentified ganglion cell types that exist in other mammalian retinas.},

abstract = {Thalamic neurons can exhibit two distinct firing modes: tonic and burst. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the tonic mode appears as a relatively faithful relay of visual information from retina to cortex. The function of the burst mode is less understood. Its prevalence during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and linkage to synchronous cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) suggest that it has an important role during this form of sleep. Although not nearly as common, bursting can also occur during wakefulness. The goal of this study was to identify conditions that affect burst probability, and to compare burst incidence during sleeping and waking. LGN neurons are extraordinarily heterogenous in the degree to which they burst, during both sleeping and waking. Some LGN neurons never burst under any conditions during wakefulness, and several never burst during slow-wave sleep. During wakefulness, <1\% of action potentials were associated with bursting, whereas during sleep this fraction jumps to 18\%. Although bursting was most common during slow-wave sleep, more than 50\% of the bursting originated from 14\% of the LGN cells. Bursting during sleep was largely restricted to episodes lasting 1-5 s, with approximately 47\% of these episodes being rhythmic and in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz). In wakefulness, although visual stimulation accounted for the greatest number of bursts, it was still a small fraction of the total response (4\%, 742 bursts/17,744 cycles in 93 cells). We identified two variables that appeared to influence burst probability: size of the visual stimuli used to elicit responses and behavioral state. Increased stimulus size increased burst probability. We attribute this to the increased influence large stimuli have on a cell's inhibitory mechanisms. As with sleep, a large fraction of bursting originated from a small number of cells. During visual stimulation, 50\% of bursting was generated by 9\% of neurons. Increased vigilance was negatively correlated with burst probability. Visual stimuli presented during active fixation (i.e., when the animal must fixate on an overt fixation point) were less likely to produce bursting, than when the same visual stimuli were presented but no fixation point present ("passive" fixation). Such observations suggest that even brief departures from attentive states can hyperpolarize neurons sufficiently to de-inactivate the burst mechanism. Our results provide a new view of the temporal structure of bursting during slow-wave sleep; one that supports episodic rhythmic activity in the intact animal. In addition, because bursting could be tied to specific conditions within wakefulness, we suggest that bursting has a specific function within that state.},

abstract = {Neurons produce complex patterns of electrical spikes, which are often clustered in bursts. The patterns of spikes and bursts can change substantially when neurons are exposed to toxins and chemical agents. For that reason, characterization of these patterns is important for the development of neuron-based biosensors for environmental threat exposure. Here, we develop a quantitative approach to describe the distribution of interspike intervals, based on plotting histograms of the logarithm of the interspike interval. This approach provides a method for automatically classifying spikes into bursts, which does not depend on assumptions about the burst parameters. Furthermore, the approach provides a sensitive technique for detecting changes in spike and burst patterns induced by pharmacological exposure. Hence, it is suitable for use both as a research tool and for deployment in a neuron-based biosensor.},

abstract = {The production of functional human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neuronal cells is critical for the application of hESCs in treating neurodegenerative disorders. To study the potential functionality of hESC-derived neurons, we cultured and monitored the development of hESC-derived neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays. Immunocytochemical studies revealed that these networks were positive for the neuronal marker proteins beta-tubulin(III) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2). The hESC-derived neuronal networks were spontaneously active and exhibited a multitude of electrical impulse firing patterns. Synchronous bursts of electrical activity similar to those reported for hippocampal neurons and rodent embryonic stem cell-derived neuronal networks were recorded from the differentiated cultures until up to 4 months. The dependence of the observed neuronal network activity on sodium ion channels was examined using tetrodotoxin (TTX). Antagonists for the glutamate receptors NMDA [D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid] and AMPA/kainate [6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione], and for GABAA receptors [(-)-bicuculline methiodide] modulated the spontaneous electrical activity, indicating that pharmacologically susceptible neuronal networks with functional synapses had been generated. The findings indicate that hESC-derived neuronal cells can generate spontaneously active networks with synchronous communication in vitro, and are therefore suitable for use in developmental and drug screening studies, as well as for regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a firing statistics based neuronal network burst detection algorithm for neuronal networks exhibiting highly variable action potential dynamics. Electrical activity of neuronal networks is generally analyzed by the occurrences of spikes and bursts both in time and space. Commonly accepted analysis tools employ burst detection algorithms based on predefined criteria. However, maturing neuronal networks, such as those originating from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), exhibit highly variable network structure and time-varying dynamics. To explore the developing burst/spike activities of such networks, we propose a burst detection algorithm which utilizes the firing statistics based on interspike interval (ISI) histograms. Moreover, the algorithm calculates ISI thresholds for burst spikes as well as for pre-burst spikes and burst tails by evaluating the cumulative moving average (CMA) and skewness of the ISI histogram. Because of the adaptive nature of the proposed algorithm, its analysis power is not limited by the type of neuronal cell network at hand. We demonstrate the functionality of our algorithm with two different types of microelectrode array (MEA) data recorded from spontaneously active hESC-derived neuronal cell networks. The same data was also analyzed by two commonly employed burst detection algorithms and the differences in burst detection results are illustrated. The results demonstrate that our method is both adaptive to the firing statistics of the network and yields successful burst detection from the data. In conclusion, the proposed method is a potential tool for analyzing of hESC-derived neuronal cell networks and thus can be utilized in studies aiming to understand the development and functioning of human neuronal networks and as an analysis tool for in vitro drug screening and neurotoxicity assays.},

	abstract = {During development, cortical neurons show highly synchronized spontaneous activity. This spontaneous activity probably reflects the mechanisms underlying proper network formation regulated by activity-dependent synaptic modification. To see long-term transitions in this spontaneous activity, we constructed a microelectrode-array (MEA)-based continuous monitoring system. Rat cortical neurons were cultured on MEAs with 64 embedded electrodes and maintained in a conventional CO2 incubator. A perfusion system for medium changes and recording setup for electrical signals were directly connected to the MEA in the incubator. Culture medium was continuously perfused at a very slow rate (0.1 ml/h), which was quite effective at maintaining constant conditions without contamination. Using this system, we succeeded in recording spontaneous activity of cultured cortical networks, almost continuously from 5 days to more than 1 month in vitro. It was revealed that the spontaneous activity patterns showed transition from simple synchronized bursts to a complex mixture of multiple patterns, separated by a brief silent period at approximately 2 weeks in vitro.

abstract = {The characteristics and mechanisms of synchronized firing in developing networks of cultured cortical neurons were studied using multisite recording through planar electrode arrays (PEAs). With maturation of the network (from 3 to 40 d after plating), the frequency and propagation velocity of bursts increased markedly (approximately from 0.01 to 0.5 Hz and from 5 to 100 mm/sec, respectively), and the sensitivity to extracellular magnesium concentration (0-10 mM) decreased. The source of spontaneous bursts, estimated from the relative delay of onset of activity between electrodes, varied randomly with each burst. Physical separation of synchronously bursting networks into several parts using an ultraviolet laser, divided synchronous bursting into different frequencies and phases in each part. Focal stimulation through the PEA was effective at multiple sites in eliciting bursts, which propagated over the network from the site of stimulation. Stimulated bursts exhibited both an absolute refractory period and a relative refractory period, in which partially propagating bursts could be elicited. Periodic electrical stimulation (at 1 to 30 sec intervals) produced slower propagation velocities and smaller numbers of spikes per burst at shorter stimulation intervals. These results suggest that the generation and propagation of spontaneous synchronous bursts in cultured cortical neurons is governed by the level of spontaneous presynaptic firing, by the degree of connectivity of the network, and by a distributed balance between excitation and recovery processes.},

abstract = {Bursts of action potentials within neurons and throughout networks are believed to serve roles in how neurons handle and store information, both in vivo and in vitro. Accurate detection of burst occurrences and durations are therefore crucial for many studies. A number of algorithms have been proposed to do so, but a standard method has not been adopted. This is due, in part, to many algorithms requiring the adjustment of multiple ad-hoc parameters and further post-hoc criteria in order to produce satisfactory results. Here, we broadly catalog existing approaches and present a new approach requiring the selection of only a single parameter: the number of spikes N comprising the smallest burst to consider. A burst was identified if N spikes occurred in less than T ms, where the threshold T was automatically determined from observing a probability distribution of inter-spike-intervals. Performance was compared vs. different classes of detectors on data gathered from in vitro neuronal networks grown over microelectrode arrays. Our approach offered a number of useful features including: a simple implementation, no need for ad-hoc or post-hoc criteria, and precise assignment of burst boundary time points. Unlike existing approaches, detection was not biased toward larger bursts, allowing identification and analysis of a greater range of neuronal and network dynamics.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that brief (<25 ms) bursts of high-frequency firing have special importance in brain function. Recent work shows that many central synapses are surprisingly unreliable at signaling the arrival of single presynaptic action potentials to the postsynaptic neuron. However, bursts are reliably signaled because transmitter release is facilitated. Thus, these synapses can be viewed as filters that transmit bursts, but filter out single spikes. Bursts appear to have a special role in synaptic plasticity and information processing. In the hippocampus, a single burst can produce long-term synaptic modifications. In brain structures whose computational role is known, action potentials that arrive in bursts provide more-precise information than action potentials that arrive singly. These results, and the requirement for multiple inputs to fire a cell suggest that the best stimulus for exciting a cell (that is, a neural code) is coincident bursts.},

Critical to this is the directed differentiation of hiPSCs into functional cell lineages. This is of particular relevance to research into neurological disease, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), in which midbrain dopaminergic neurons degenerate during disease progression but are unobtainable until post-mortem. Here we report a detailed study into the physiological maturation over time of human dopaminergic neurons in vitro. We first generated and differentiated hiPSC lines into midbrain dopaminergic neurons and performed a comprehensive characterisation to confirm dopaminergic functionality by demonstrating dopamine synthesis, release, and re-uptake. The neuronal cultures include cells positive for both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (Kir3.2, henceforth referred to as GIRK2), representative of the A9 population of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons vulnerable in PD. We observed for the first time the maturation of the slow autonomous pace-making (<10 Hz) and spontaneous synaptic activity typical of mature SNc dopaminergic neurons using a combination of calcium imaging and electrophysiology. hiPSC-derived neurons exhibited inositol tri-phosphate (IP3) receptor-dependent release of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum in neuronal processes as calcium waves propagating from apical and distal dendrites, and in the soma. Finally, neurons were susceptible to the dopamine neuron-specific toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) which reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and altered mitochondrial morphology. Mature hiPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons provide a neurophysiologically-defined model of previously inaccessible vulnerable SNc dopaminergic neurons to bridge the gap between clinical PD and animal models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have collected a comprehensive set of multi-unit data on dissociated cortical cultures. Previous studies of the development of the electrical activity of dissociated cultures of cortical neurons each focused on limited aspects of its dynamics, and were often based on small numbers of observed cultures. We followed 58 cultures of different densities--3000 to 50,000 neurons on areas of 30 to 75 mm2--growing on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) during the first five weeks of their development. RESULTS: Plating density had a profound effect on development. While the aggregate spike detection rate scaled linearly with density, as expected from the number of cells in proximity to electrodes, dense cultures started to exhibit bursting behavior earlier in development than sparser cultures. Analysis of responses to electrical stimulation suggests that axonal outgrowth likewise occurred faster in dense cultures. After two weeks, the network activity was dominated by population bursts in most cultures. In contrast to previous reports, development continued with changing burst patterns throughout the observation period. Burst patterns were extremely varied, with inter-burst intervals between 1 and 300 s, different amounts of temporal clustering of bursts, and different firing rate profiles during bursts. During certain stages of development bursts were organized into tight clusters with highly conserved internal structure. CONCLUSION: Dissociated cultures of cortical cells exhibited a much richer repertoire of activity patterns than previously reported. Except for the very sparsest cultures, all cultures exhibited globally synchronized bursts, but bursting patterns changed over the course of development, and varied considerably between preparations. This emphasizes the importance of using multiple preparations--not just multiple cultures from one preparation--in any study involving neuronal cultures. These results are based on 963 half-hour-long recordings. To encourage further investigation of the rich range of behaviors exhibited by cortical cells in vitro, we are making the data available to other researchers, together with Matlab code to facilitate access.},

As an initial step toward this end, the present studies evaluated an automated, high-throughput method for screening chemical effects on proliferation and viability using ReNcell CX cells, a human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) line. ReNcell CX cells doubled in approximately 36 h and expressed the neural progenitor markers nestin and SOX2. High-throughput assays for cell proliferation (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation) and viability (propidium iodide exclusion) were optimized and tested using known antiproliferative compounds. The utility of this in vitro screen was evaluated further using a set of compounds containing eight known to cause developmental neurotoxicity and eight presumably nontoxic compounds. Six out of eight developmental neurotoxicants significantly inhibited ReNcell CX cell proliferation and/or viability, whereas two out of eight nontoxic chemicals caused only minimal effects. These results demonstrate that chemical effects on cell proliferation and viability can be assessed via high-throughput methods using hNPCs. Further development of this approach as part of a strategy to screen compounds for potential effects on nervous system development is warranted.},

abstract = {Dissociated networks of neurons typically exhibit bursting behavior, whose features are strongly influenced by the age of the culture, by chemical/electrical stimulation or by environmental conditions. To help the experimenter in identifying the changes possibly induced by specific protocols, we developed a self-adapting method for detecting both bursts and network bursts from electrophysiological activity recorded by means of micro-electrode arrays. The algorithm is based on the computation of the logarithmic inter-spike interval histogram and automatically detects the best threshold to distinguish between inter- and intra-burst inter-spike intervals for each recording channel of the array. An analogous procedure is followed for the detection of network bursts, looking for sequences of closely spaced single-channel bursts. We tested our algorithm on recordings of spontaneous as well as chemically stimulated activity, comparing its performance to other methods available in the literature.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo exhibit a wide range of firing patterns. They normally fire constantly at a low rate, and speed up, firing a phasic burst when reward exceeds prediction, or pause when an expected reward does not occur. Therefore, the detection of bursts and pauses from spike train data is a critical problem when studying the role of phasic dopamine (DA) in reward related learning, and other DA dependent behaviors. However, few statistical methods have been developed that can identify bursts and pauses simultaneously. We propose a new statistical method, the Robust Gaussian Surprise (RGS) method, which performs an exhaustive search of bursts and pauses in spike trains simultaneously. We found that the RGS method is adaptable to various patterns of spike trains recorded in vivo, and is not influenced by baseline firing rate, making it applicable to all in vivo spike trains where baseline firing rates vary over time. We compare the performance of the RGS method to other methods of detecting bursts, such as the Poisson Surprise (PS), Rank Surprise (RS), and Template methods. Analysis of data using the RGS method reveals potential mechanisms underlying how bursts and pauses are controlled in DA neurons.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that targets the corticostriatal system and results in progressive deterioration of cognitive, emotional, and motor skills. Although cortical and striatal neurons are widely studied in animal models of HD, there is little information on neuronal function during expression of the HD behavioral phenotype. To address this knowledge gap, we used chronically implanted micro-wire bundles to record extracellular spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) in truncated (R6/1 and R6/2) and full-length (knock-in, KI) mouse models as well as in transgenic HD rats (tgHD rats) behaving in an open-field arena. Spike activity was recorded in the striatum of all models and in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of R6/2 and KI mice, and in primary motor cortex (M1) of R6/2 mice. We also recorded LFP activity in R6/2 striatum. All HD models exhibited altered neuronal activity relative to wild-type (WT) controls. Although there was no consistent effect on firing rate across models and brain areas, burst firing was reduced in striatum, PFC, and M1 of R6/2 mice, and in striatum of KI mice. Consistent with a decline in bursting, the inter-spike-interval coefficient of variation was reduced in all regions of all models, except PFC of KI mice and striatum of tgHD rats. Among simultaneously recorded neuron pairs, correlated firing was reduced in all brain regions of all models, while coincident bursting, which measures the temporal overlap between bursting pairs, was reduced in striatum of all models as well as in M1 of R6/2s. Preliminary analysis of striatal LFPs revealed aberrant behavior-related oscillations in the delta to theta range and in gamma activity. Collectively, our results indicate that disrupted corticostriatal processing occurs across multiple HD models despite differences in the severity of the behavioral phenotype. Efforts aimed at normalizing corticostriatal activity may hold the key to developing new HD therapeutics.},

abstract = {Developing retinal ganglion cells fire in correlated spontaneous bursts, resulting in propagating waves with robust spatiotemporal features preserved across development and species. Here we investigate the effects of homeostatic adaptation on the circuits controlling retinal waves. Mouse retinal waves were recorded in vitro for up to 35 h with a multielectrode array in presence of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline, allowing us to obtain a precise, time-resolved characterization of homeostatic effects in this preparation. Experiments were performed at P4-P6, when GABA(A) signaling is depolarizing in ganglion cells, and at P7-P10, when GABA(A) signaling is hyperpolarizing. At all ages, bicuculline initially increased the wave sizes and other activity metrics. At P5-P6, wave sizes decreased toward control levels within a few hours while firing remained strong, but this ability to compensate disappeared entirely from P7 onwards. This demonstrates that homeostatic control of spontaneous retinal activity maintains specific network dynamic properties in an age-dependent manner, and suggests that the underlying mechanism is linked to GABA(A) signaling.},

abstract = {The activity state of neuronal networks can be characterized by the spatial-temporal grouping of their action potentials given a sufficiently large simultaneous recording sample. A sequence of action potentials (spike train) often has high frequency spike episodes that are generally called bursts. However, bursts are difficult to quantify and require operational definitions that reflect the type of activity and the interest of the experimenter. This paper presents a simple method for defining bursts as strings of spikes with only two parameters: a minimum number of spikes per burst and a maximum interspike interval. These two values represent a simple parameterization that is adequate for the description of temporal grouping in spike trains. Because this method has a minimal computation time, it allows implementation of burst analysis in real-time, including statistical changes in burst variables, histograms of burst types, and patterns in combinations of burst variables.},

abstract = {In the immature retina, correlated spontaneous activity in the form of propagating waves is thought to be necessary for the refinement of connections between the retina and its targets. The continued presence of this activity in the mature retina would interfere with the transmission of information about the visual scene. The mechanisms responsible for the disappearance of retinal waves are not well understood, but one hypothesis is that visual experience is important. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the developmental changes in spontaneous retinal activity of both normal mice and mice reared in the dark. Using multi-electrode array recordings, we found that retinal waves in normally reared mice are present at postnatal day (P) 9 and begin to break down shortly after eye opening, around P15. By P21, waves have disappeared, and synchronous firing is comparable with that observed in the adult (6 weeks). In mice raised in the dark, we found a similar time course for the disappearance of waves. However, at P15, dark-reared retinas occasionally showed abnormally long periods of relative inactivity, not seen in controls. Apart from this quiescence, we found no striking differences between the patterns of spontaneous retinal activity from normal and dark-reared mice. We therefore suggest that visual experience is not required for the loss of synchronous spontaneous activity.},

To examine this hypothesis, we looked for correlations in the discharge activity of pairs of neurons in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), globus pallidus externus (GPe), and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Recordings were performed in PD patients undergoing functional stereotactic mapping for pallidotomy (eight patients) or subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (four patients). A double-microelectrode setup was used to simultaneously record from neurons separated by distances as small as 250 microm. In the five pallidotomy patients without limb tremor during the procedure, none of the 73 GPi pairs and 15 GPe pairs displayed synchronous activity. In the three pallidotomy patients with limb tremor, 6 of 21 GPi pairs and 5 of 29 GPe pairs displayed oscillatory synchronization in the frequency range of the ongoing limb tremor (3-6 Hz) or at higher frequencies (15-30 Hz). Synchronized activity was not observed in the SNr (10 pairs). The findings indicate that oscillatory synchronization between pairs of GPi or GPe neurons is found in patients with limb tremor. These results also suggest that overt neuronal synchronization, which may be attributable to an increase in direct synaptic connections or common collateral afferent inputs, is not present in the basal ganglia of patients with PD.},

abstract = {Neurons in vitro and in vivo have epochs of bursting or "up state" activity during which firing rates are dramatically elevated. Various methods of detecting bursts in extracellular spike trains have appeared in the literature, the most widely used apparently being Poisson Surprise (PS). A natural description of the phenomenon assumes (1) there are two hidden states, which we label "burst" and "non-burst," (2) the neuron evolves stochastically, switching at random between these two states, and (3) within each state the spike train follows a time-homogeneous point process. If in (2) the transitions from non-burst to burst and burst to non-burst states are memoryless, this becomes a hidden Markov model (HMM). For HMMs, the state transitions follow exponential distributions, and are highly irregular. Because observed bursting may in some cases be fairly regular-exhibiting inter-burst intervals with small variation-we relaxed this assumption. When more general probability distributions are used to describe the state transitions the two-state point process model becomes a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We developed an efficient Bayesian computational scheme to fit HSMMs to spike train data. Numerical simulations indicate the method can perform well, sometimes yielding very different results than those based on PS.},

abstract = {The immature retina generates spontaneous waves of spiking activity that sweep across the ganglion cell layer during a limited period of development before the onset of visual experience. The spatiotemporal patterns encoded in the waves are believed to be instructive for the wiring of functional connections throughout the visual system. However, the ontogeny of retinal waves is still poorly documented as a result of the relatively low resolution of conventional recording techniques. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal features of mouse retinal waves from birth until eye opening in unprecedented detail using a large-scale, dense, 4096-channel multielectrode array that allowed us to record from the entire neonatal retina at near cellular resolution. We found that early cholinergic waves propagate with random trajectories over large areas with low ganglion cell recruitment. They become slower, smaller and denser when GABAA signalling matures, as occurs beyond postnatal day (P) 7. Glutamatergic influences dominate from P10, coinciding with profound changes in activity dynamics. At this time, waves cease to be random and begin to show repetitive trajectories confined to a few localized hotspots. These hotspots gradually tile the retina with time, and disappear after eye opening. Our observations demonstrate that retinal waves undergo major spatiotemporal changes during ontogeny. Our results support the hypotheses that cholinergic waves guide the refinement of retinal targets and that glutamatergic waves may also support the wiring of retinal receptive fields.},

abstract = {Simultaneous recordings were made from small collections (2-7) of spontaneously active single units in the striate cortex of unanesthetized cats, by means of chronically implanted electrodes. The recorded spike trains were computer scanned for bursts of spikes, and the bursts were catalogued and studied. The firing rates of the neurons ranged from 0.16 to 32 spikes/s; the mean was 8.9 spikes/s, the standard deviation 7.0 spikes/s. Bursts of spikes were assigned a quantitative measure, termed Poisson surprise (S), defined as the negative logarithm of their probability in a random (Poisson) spike train. Only bursts having S greater than 10, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about 0.01 bursts/1,000 spikes in a random spike train, were considered to be of interest. Bursts having S greater than 10 occurred at a rate of about 5-15 bursts/1,000 spikes, or about 1-5 bursts/min. The rate slightly increased with spike rate; averaging about 2 bursts/min for neurons having 3 spikes/s and about 4.5 bursts/min for neurons having 30 spikes/s. About 21\% of the recorded units emitted significantly fewer bursts than the rest (below 1 burst/1,000 spikes). The percentage of these neurons was independent of spike rate. The spike rate during bursts was found to be about 3-6 times the average spike rate; about the same for longer as for shorter bursts. Bursts typically contained 10-50 spikes and lasted 0.5-2.0 s. When the number of spikes in the successively emitted bursts was listed, it was found that in some neurons these numbers were not distributed at random but were clustered around one or more preferred values. In this sense, bursts occasionally "recurred" a few times in a few minutes. The finding suggests that neurons are highly reliable. When bursts of two or more simultaneously recorded neurons were compared, the bursts often appeared to be temporally close, especially between pairs of neurons recorded by the same electrode; but bursts seldom started and ended simultaneously on two channels. Recurring bursts emitted by one neuron were occasionally accompanied by time-locked recurring bursts by other neurons.},

In addition, the used in vitro models are mostly based on molecular biological end-point analyses. Thus, for neurotoxicological screening, human cell-based analysis platforms in which the functional neuronal networks responses for various neurotoxicants can be also detected real-time are highly needed. Microelectrode array (MEA) is a method which enables the measurement of functional activity of neuronal cell networks in vitro for long periods of time. Here, we utilize MEA to study the neurotoxicity of methyl mercury chloride (MeHgCl, concentrations 0.5-500 nM) to human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neuronal cell networks exhibiting spontaneous electrical activity. The neuronal cell cultures were matured on MEAs into networks expressing spontaneous spike train-like activity before exposing the cells to MeHgCl for 72 h. MEA measurements were performed acutely and 24, 48, and 72 h after the onset of the exposure. Finally, exposed cells were analyzed with traditional molecular biological methods for cell proliferation, cell survival, and gene and protein expression. Our results show that 500 nM MeHgCl decreases the electrical signaling and alters the pharmacologic response of hESC-derived neuronal networks in delayed manner whereas effects can not be detected with qRT-PCR, immunostainings, or proliferation measurements. Thus, we conclude that human cell-based MEA platform is a sensitive online method for neurotoxicological screening.},

abstract = {In spike-train data, bursts are considered as a unit of neural information and are of potential interest in studies of responses to any sensory stimulus. Consequently, burst detection appears to be a critical problem for which the Poisson-surprise (PS) method has been widely used for 20 years. However, this method has faced some recurrent criticism about the underlying assumptions regarding the interspike interval (ISI) distributions. In this paper, we avoid such assumptions by using a nonparametric approach for burst detection based on the ranks of ISI in the entire spike train. Similar to the PS statistic, a "Rank surprise" (RS) statistic is extracted. A new algorithm performing an exhaustive search of bursts in the spike trains is also presented. Compared to the performances of the PS method on realizations of gamma renewal processes and spike trains recorded in cat auditory cortex, we show that the RS method is very robust for any type of ISI distribution and is based on an elementary formalization of the definition of a burst. It presents an alternative to the PS method for non-Poisson spike trains and is simple to implement.},

abstract = {Embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into neurons of diverse neurotransmitter-specific phenotypes. While the time course of functional progression of ES cell-derived neural precursors towards mature neurons has been described in detail on single-cell level, the temporal development and pharmacological modulation of ES cell-derived neuronal network activity have not been explored yet. Neuronal network activity can be assessed by the microelectrode array (MEA) technology that allows simultaneous monitoring of the electrical activity exhibited by entire populations of neurons over several weeks or months in vitro. We demonstrate here that ES cell-derived neural precursors cultured on MEAs for 5 to 6 weeks develop neuronal networks with oscillating and synchronous spike patterns via distinct states of activity and change electrophysiological characteristics even after 5 to 6 weeks in culture pointing towards late maturational processes. These processes were accompanied by an increasing density of presynaptic vesicles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ES cell-derived network activity was sensitive to synaptically acting drugs indicating that pharmacologically susceptible neuronal networks were generated. Thus, the MEA technology represents a powerful tool to describe the temporal progression of stem cell-derived neural populations towards mature, functioning neuronal networks that can be applied to investigate pharmacologically active compounds.},

	abstract = {Most neuronal networks, even in the absence of external stimuli, produce spontaneous bursts of spikes separated by periods of reduced activity. The origin and functional role of these neuronal events are still unclear. The present work shows that the spontaneous activity of two very different networks, intact leech ganglia and dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, share several features. Indeed, in both networks: i) the inter-spike intervals distribution of the spontaneous firing of single neurons is either regular or periodic or bursting, with the fraction of bursting neurons depending on the network activity; ii) bursts of spontaneous spikes have the same broad distributions of size and duration; iii) the degree of correlated activity increases with the bin width, and the power spectrum of the network firing rate has a 1/f behavior at low frequencies, indicating the existence of long-range temporal correlations; iv) the activity of excitatory synaptic pathways mediated by NMDA receptors is necessary for the onset of the long-range correlations and for the presence of large bursts; v) blockage of inhibitory synaptic pathways mediated by GABA(A) receptors causes instead an increase in the correlation among neurons and leads to a burst distribution composed only of very small and very large bursts. These results suggest that the spontaneous electrical activity in neuronal networks with different architectures and functions can have very similar properties and common dynamics.},

We have analyzed spatio-temporal profiles of the distribution of spikes in the bursts recorded after 2 weeks in vitro. We have found a statistically significant similarity between the spiking patterns in sequential bursting events, we refer to these spiking patterns as spiking signatures. Such spiking signatures may appear in different parts of the bursts, including the activation patterns - the first spike times in the bursts, and deactivation patterns - the last spike times in the bursts. Moreover, these patterns may display apparent time scaling, e.g., they may be replayed in the subsequent bursts at different speeds, while preserving the spiking order. We discuss how such properties of the bursts may be associated with the formation of repeatable signaling pathways in cultured networks in vitro.},

abstract = {We have developed methods to detect and discern burst and oscillatory patterns of neuronal activity. In them, a burst period is defined as an interval in which there are a significantly higher number of spikes as compared to other intervals in the spike train. Oscillation is defined as a spike train in which significant periodicity is detected in its autocorrelogram. The main feature of our burst detection method is that discharge density (i.e., the number of spikes in a short interval) is used instead of the interspike interval. This enables one to assess the likelihood of having burst periods in a spike train. We use the Lomb periodogram to detect periodicity in an autocorrelogram. This method gives one significance of periodicity detected and enables the detection of multiple frequencies in an autocorrelogram. The advantage of these methods is discussed in comparison with the other methods used to detect bursting and oscillatory activity.},

	abstract = {Primary cultures of neuronal networks grown on microelectrode arrays were used to quantify acute effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) on spontaneous spike and burst activity. For frontal cortex cultures, fluoxetine showed consistent inhibitory effects and terminated activity at 10-16 ??M. IC50 mean??S.E. for spike rates was 5.4??0.7 ??M (n=15). For auditory cortex cultures, fluoxetine caused excitation at 1-10 ??M, initial inhibition at 15 ??M, and activity cessation at 20-25 ??M. The spike rate IC50 was 15.9??1.0 ??M (n=11). Fluoxetine did not change the action potential waveform shape. However, at high concentrations, it caused total cessation of spike activity on all channels. The inhibition caused by fluoxetine was reversible for both tissues. Based on the results, we conclude that cultures showed repeatable, concentration-dependent sensitivities to fluoxetine but demonstrated tissue-specific responses for frontal and auditory cortex networks. These responses may not be due to the interference with serotonin reuptake, but may be due to a secondary effect on ionic channels. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, the immaturity of cultured human iPSC-derived neurons and the lack of established functional evaluation methods are problematic. We here used a multi-electrode array (MEA) system to investigate the effects of the co-culture of rat astrocytes with hiPSC-derived neurons on the long-term culture, spontaneous firing activity, and drug responsiveness effects. The co-culture facilitated the long-term culture of hiPSC-derived neurons for >3 months and long-term spontaneous firing activity was also observed. After >3 months of culture, we observed synchronous burst firing activity due to synapse transmission within neuronal networks. Compared with rat neurons, hiPSC-derived neurons required longer time to mature functionally. Furthermore, addition of the synapse antagonists bicuculline and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione induced significant changes in the firing rate. In conclusion, we used a MEA system to demonstrate that the co-culture of hiPSC-derived neurons with rat astrocytes is an effective method for studying the function of human neuronal cells, which could be used for drug screening. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We have developed a new method for culturing cells that maintains their health and sterility for many months. Using conventional techniques, primary neuron cultures seldom survive more than 2 months. Increases in the osmotic strength of media due to evaporation are a large and underappreciated contributor to the gradual decline in the health of these cultures. Because of this and the ever-present likelihood of contamination by airborne pathogens, repeated or extended experiments on any given culture have until now been difficult, if not impossible. We surmounted survival problems by using culture dish lids that form a gas-tight seal, and incorporate a transparent hydrophobic membrane (fluorinated ethylene-propylene) that is selectively permeable to oxygen (O(2)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)), and relatively impermeable to water vapor. This prevents contamination and greatly reduces evaporation, allowing the use of a non-humidified incubator. We have employed this technique to grow dissociated cortical cultures from rat embryos on multi-electrode arrays. After more than a year in culture, the neurons still exhibit robust spontaneous electrical activity. The combination of sealed culture dishes with extracellular multi-electrode recording and stimulation enables study of development, adaptation, and very long-term plasticity, across months, in cultured neuronal networks. Membrane-sealed dishes will also be useful for the culture of many other cell types susceptible to evaporation and contamination.},

Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons may be effectively used for understanding the plasticity mechanism in human neuronal networks, thereby elucidating disease mechanisms and drug discoveries. In this study, we attempted the induction of \{LTP\} and \{LTD\} phenomena in a cultured hiPSC-derived cerebral cortical neuronal network using multi-electrode array (MEA) systems. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) produced a potentiated and depressed transmission in a neuronal circuit for 1 h in the evoked responses by test stimulus. The cross-correlation of responses revealed that spike patterns with specific timing were generated during \{LTP\} induction and disappeared during \{LTD\} induction and that the hiPSC-derived cortical neuronal network has the potential to repeatedly express the spike pattern with a precise timing change within 0.5 ms. We also detected the phenomenon for late-phase \{LTP\} (L-LTP) like plasticity and the effects for synchronized burst firing (SBF) in spontaneous firings by HFS. In conclusion, we detected the \{LTP\} and \{LTD\} phenomena in a hiPSC-derived neuronal network as the change of spike pattern. The studies of plasticity using hiPSC-derived neurons and a \{MEA\} system may be beneficial for clarifying the functions of human neuronal circuits and for applying to drug screening. "
